# Change application name in menubar from "Python" to <your app name>
    1. app_maker constructs an info.plist file and places it in Resources.
    2. Canopy1.0 python however has a info.plist that trumps the app_maker info.plist.
        Remove canopy's info.plist located at
        $HOME/Library/Enthought/Canopy_64bit/User/Resources/Python.app/Contents/Info.plist
        backup the file by changing to
        $HOME/Library/Enthought/Canopy_64bit/User/Resources/Python.app/Contents/~Info.plist
        
        now the Info.plist at
        <pychron_app>/Contents/Info.plist is used.

# use pythonw instead of python
